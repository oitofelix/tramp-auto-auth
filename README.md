# tramp-auto-auth
TRAMP automatic authentication library

This library provides `tramp-auto-auth-mode`: a global minor mode
whose purpose is to automatically feed TRAMP sub-processes with
passwords for paths matching regexps.  This is useful in situations
where interactive user input is not desirable or feasible.  For
instance, in sub-nets with large number of hosts or whose hosts have
dynamic IPs assigned to them.  In those cases it’s not practical to
query passwords using the `auth-source` library directly, since this
would require each host to be listed explicitly and immutably in a
Netrc file.  Another scenario where this mode is useful are
non-interactive Emacs sessions (like those used for batch processing
or by evaluating `:async` Org Babel source blocks) in which it’s
impossible for the user to answer a password-asking prompt.

When a TRAMP prompt is encountered, `tramp-auto-auth-mode` queries the
alist `tramp-auto-auth-alist` for the auth-source spec value whose
regexp key matches the correspondent TRAMP path.  This spec is then
used to query the auth-source library for a presumably phony entry
exclusively dedicated to the whole class of TRAMP paths matching that
regexp.

To make use of the automatic authentication feature, on the Lisp side
the variable `tramp-auto-auth-alist` must be customized to hold the
path regexps and their respective auth-source specs, and then
`tramp-auto-auth-mode` must be enabled.  For example:

---- ~/.emacs.el -------------------------------------------------
```
(require 'tramp-auto-auth)

(add-to-list
 'tramp-auto-auth-alist
 '("root@10\\.0\\." .
   (:host "Funny-Machines" :user "root" :port "ssh")))

(tramp-auto-auth-mode)
```
------------------------------------------------------------------

After this, just put the respective sacred secret in an
authentication source supported by auth-source library.  For
instance:

---- ~/.authinfo.gpg ---------------------------------------------
```
machine Funny-Machines login root password "$r00tP#sWD!" port ssh
```
------------------------------------------------------------------

In case you are feeling lazy or the secret is not so secret (nor so
sacred) -- or for any reason you need to do it all from Lisp --
it’s enough to:

```
(auth-source-remember '(:host "Funny-Machines" :user "root" :port "ssh")
		         '((:secret "$r00tP#sWD!")))
```

And happy TRAMPing!
